Basic Modeling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- line tool
	- snap to axes
	- snap to ref point
	- line-line intersection
	- overlapping lines cases
	- polygon forming
		- identify planes and make edge lists for each plane bounded by the new segments.
		- make a rotation matrix for the plane (have a camera looking at the plane).
			- compute 2D edge pseudo-angles in the plane matrix.
		- exclude non-cycling edges in the region detection algorithm.
		- find embedded polygons (holes)
			- generate meshes with earclip
		- replace existing polygons with new polygons while preserving textures
- select faces and lines
- double-click to select face boundary lines
	- double-click again to select all lines and faces.
- del to remove selection
- move hit point
- move selection
- rotate selection
- eraser tool
- move axes
- reverse selected faces
- make group from selection
- break group
- make component

- rectangle tool
- arc tool
- circle tool
- push-pull tool
