Outputs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- zoning requirements
	- show site limits and window restrictions
- energy losses/gains estimated per month
	- separate for heating, cooling, hot water, lighting, appliances
- sun energy input based on orientation, geography, shading, glazing.
- shading study
- excavation plan
- bill of materials
- bill of work (time & money)
- optimized material cut plans
- suply scheduling
- work scheduling
- construction phases dependency tree
- electric schema with optimized load distribution
- mechanical ventilation requirements based on house air tightness
- worksheets
	- steel rebar bending
	- board cutting
	- wood cutting
- gant chart
- render house at different building stages
- keep a building log / checklist
- solutions pros/cons tables
- price comparisons
- centralized maintenance schedule


Monetization
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- acces to plans and reports
- online shop of materials and services
- for-authorization documentation
- geo study service
- authorization service
- a-to-z service on selected plans
- a-to-z service on custom plans with consultancy
- insurance service
- custom materials, suppliers and prices
- smart home kit


Web Advantages
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- phone data entry & reporting
- leverage x-widgets, three.js
- information sharing
- component sharing (from vendors etc. with metadata incl. price etc., auto-updated as well)
- built-in communication
- auto-updates
- auto-upgrade model files to latest format
	- still need backward compat for export formats.


Desktop Advantages
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- developer control over performance and tech used:
	- 3D engine
	- hardware integration
- easier programming with integrated frontend and backend
- user ownership of both program and data
	- though susceptible to bit rot unless open-sourced and maintained.
