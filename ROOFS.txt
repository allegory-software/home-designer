ROOF ANALYSIS

- roof slope intersections: create hips and valleys at 45 deg if both have the same slope.

- gable roofs:
	- unlike hip roofs, the sides can be segmented and fall at different elevations.
		- can follow *any* wall contour with constant eaves width
		- ridge can be adjusted on _|_ axis to achieve half-floor on one side and full on the other

- same-slope roofs intersecting on the same axis and on a common wall => merged faces.

- gables intersecting walls:
	- ??

- gables cross-intersecting gables:
	- eave elevation alignment:
		- same: valley extends to form eave
		- diff: lower roof extends underneath the eave of the upper roof

- hip roofs cross-intersecting walls (porches):
	- on one face: can have constant slope
		- can wrap around side walls
	- on outside corner: can't have constant slope if hip is meant to meet at the corner

- side roofs:
	- can wrap around a suspended volume (volume creates inside + outside corners)
	- can wrap around the house (house side corners)
	- shading roof: secondary single-slope roof attached to gable-end wall
	- porch: lower-sloped roof extending side of house roof

- dormers:
	- front face:
		- aligned to wall underneath: face stands on wall, roof goes around it
		- suspended: just like other faces
	- back face:
		- completely sunk, dormer roof intersects house roof
	- single-slope dormer roof aligns with house ridge
	- combined dormers of different roof types





ORNAMENTAL DETAILS

- trellis attached to wall

- eaves closing:
	- soffit
	- exposed rafters (cut straight-to-ground or straight-to-rafter)
	- fascia board

- double-angle eaves (ornamental):
	- just attach extensions to rafters at an angle

- gable sides detail at gable end wall:
	- no detail
	- connect each side with a continuous little one-slope roof (ugly)
	- wrap around the gable end wall with a little 2-side hip roof (ugly)
	- if there's a soffit, close it with a triangle: at face (ugly) or at wall (meh)

- trellis joist header continuing porch lintel
