WALL OFFSETING WITH OPENINGS

	- METHOD 1 / GEOMETRIC:
		- keep a parallel set of segs that are broken at openings
		- find_comps() -- seg split can create islands
		- extract_cycles() -- there should be no inner cycles
			- except for basements and mansards which should have a stair.
		- create_edges()
	- METHOD 2 / RASTER:
		- create clipping rects for openings before painting the walls.
		- draw wall strokes with proper miter (extend the corners a little).
		- draw openings over.

- TODO: drag-move opening: pick the closest free range and clamp to it.

- TODO: drag-move opening:
	- TODO: pick the closest wall
		- go outside walls if no wall is close enough

- drag opening:
	- constrain position to free space when moving and resizing
	- resize by each end
	- move outside walls on the empty space
	- auto-shrink to fit free space on the wall + padding

- FINISH: scalable drawing
	- TODO: zoom in/out/reset
	- TODO: fixate scale while dragging
